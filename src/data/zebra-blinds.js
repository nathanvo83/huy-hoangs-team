      "A simple pulling of the strings to close up space between two fabrics allows you total control in terms of the natural light and heat that comes into your room. It keeps your room cooler for longer and saves you energy and cost. If you prefer total privacy, you can also adjust your rainbow blinds to ensure that the perforated areas are totally obscured.",
      "Rainbow blinds require minimal upkeep. All you need is a cleaning cloth or a brush and you can dust off the accumulated dirt. They are quite durable too.",
      "Rainbow blinds come in automated options, which you can control via mobile apps or a separate remote control device.

      "Zebra blinds are also commonly known as shadow blinds, combi-blinds, zebra blinds. Traditional blinds normally only have one layer. However, rainbow blinds incorporate two layers of fabrics. These two layers are often made up of polyester and one perforated material. Like traditional blinds, you have a pulley string system to control the ascent and descent of the blinds. The fabrics can be adjusted to let in your desired amount of natural light. The result is a unique consolidation of horizontal and roller blinds function into a single form.",
      "Operating rainbow blinds is much like standard roller blinds Of course, the quality of the mechanism is an essential factor for the durability and lifespan of your blinds. Other than ease of control, the sheer material generally used for rainbow blinds radiates subtle elegance analogous to sheer elegant curtains. In spite of this, privacy protection and UV light control are not compromised"
