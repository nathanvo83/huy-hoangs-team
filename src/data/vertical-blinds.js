      "Vertical blinds are the ideal alternative to traditional curtains. For those who are looking to transition from curtains to blinds, vertical blinds would be the top recommended option. Made of light materials and with roughly the same level of manageability, they are akin to your traditional curtains, but made better. The extra feature of allowing you to adjust how you filter natural light into a room – thus controlling privacy – puts vertical blinds notches above your traditional curtains. In addition, they offer better heat and cold installation that ordinary fabric curtains.",
