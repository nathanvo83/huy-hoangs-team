      "The motors for our motorised blinds are installed in the tube of the blind, so they are completely invisible. They also don’t require any additional clearance. As a result, all the roller blinds in our range can be motorised, whether you want blackout blinds, thermal blinds, sunscreen blinds, light filtering blinds, or dual roller blinds.",
      "In addition, our motorised blinds don’t need to be connected to your electrics, and there are no wires. Instead, they are powered by battery. The recharging options are either solar or via a USB cable. The blinds take about eight hours to charge, but a single charge can open/close your blinds up to 500 times.",
