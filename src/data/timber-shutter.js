      "While everyone has their own unique tastes, an overwhelming majority of people (especially here in the South) LOVE the look of shutters. They are timeless and never go out of style. Due to the fact that they cannot be purchased off the shelf like some other window coverings, they offer a truly custom look. Whether your style is traditional, transitional, or contemporary, there is a shutter style to match. Additionally, shutters have incredible curb appeal, meaning they look beautiful from the street.",
      "When you purchase quality shutters for your home you are investing in something that should last you decades. There are no cords and strings that could potentially tangle and no fabrics that could stain or snag. Shutters are hardy products that can definitely stand the test of time if cared for properly. Shutters typically have double the life of other window covering products, which makes it a no brainer as a good investment!",
      "If you are like most and want low maintenance fixtures, shutters are for you! They are extremely easy to maintain and clean. All you need is a Swiffer duster and you are good to go! Also, if something spills or splashes on your shutter it can easily be wiped away with a damp cloth."

      "Shutters are the superheroes of the window treatment world. Durable, timeless, clean, and dependable, plantation shutters can save you money on energy costs, add curb appeal to your home, and are a reliable system of light control. Louvers easily angle up and down to provide unobstructed views when open and shut out almost all light when closed.",
      "Constructed from recyclable vinyl with the look of painted wood, faux wood shutters are easy to clean and are guaranteed not to fade, peel, or warp. Wood shutters are created from solid basswood and highly valued for window coverings due to the woodâ€™s superior quality, even texture, and attractive grain."
