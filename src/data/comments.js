        comment: "I had a very happy experience with Peter from SOHO Blinds.  I chose to go with Zebra blinds after he showed me a range of different colors and designs.  He took me to view another home that had just recently installed the zebra blinds and I was definitely convinced that my choice was the right one.  The installation was fast and clean my home looks so beautiful and it all ties in nicely.  I am a very satisfied customer and highly recommend him.  Thank you Peter and team.",
