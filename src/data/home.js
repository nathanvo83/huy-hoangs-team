      "Our lowest prices policy applies to any lower price on an item that is in-stock and available for delivery or collection on the same day from a competitor’s online or physical store in New Zealand. It applies where our competitor’s price (including GST and delivery charges), is lower than our price.",
      "We recognise that despite everything we do to provide our products at the lowest prices we can’t always be the lowest at every instant on everything. So, if you find a competitor's lower price (including GST and delivery charges) on the same in-stock item that’s available for same-day delivery or collection, we'll beat it by 15%. Don't forget this excludes trade quotes, stock liquidations and commercial quantities."
